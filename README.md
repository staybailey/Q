# Q

    Q is a community playlist app that allows users to share and manage a music playlist together in a group setting. With Q, a designated host can create a room in which other users can join. In this room, users and the host can collaborate on a playlist by searching for songs on Soundcloud and adding them to a playlist queue. The host has the ability to play, pause, skip, and delete songs on the playlist. Audio is only played through the hosts computer or device. You and the people around you can all use Q's server to search for music and manage the playlist together in REAL-TIME.
